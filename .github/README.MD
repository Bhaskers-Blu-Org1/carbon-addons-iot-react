# IoT Widget Library

This library contains React components shared between all IBM IoT products to unify our look and feel. These widgets are usually based on the carbon-components-react widgets. These components cover additional usecases specific to our IoT product line, much like this repository does for the IBM Cloud team: <https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-addons-cloud-react>

## Getting Started

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons carbon-addons-iot-react
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command instead:

```bash
yarn add carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons carbon-addons-iot-react
```

You can then import any component that you need by doing the following in your project:

```js
import { BaseModal } from 'carbon-addons-iot-react';
```
